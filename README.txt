XML: We've used XML to represent the information about our products.
We decided to use XML and javascript to display the products instead of making separate webpages for each product. When you go
into the linear productview, all products are added dynamically, so if you add a new product to the xml, it will automatically
be added to the productspage.

CSS: Used to style the HTML.

HTML: The skeleton of our webpage.

Javascript: Javascript is being used to make the dropdown-menu from the navigationbar. It's also being used to make the canvas
at the "About"-page. Lastly it's being used to read the XML-file.

Validating forms: Used "required" on the "Contact us"-form, both Name and Email is required to press the submit-button.
Also used the email-type, so the email-input from the user has to be on the form: "something@somthing" or "some@some.com".
