XML: We've used XML to represent the information about our products.
We decided to use XML and javascript to display the products instead of making separate webpages for each product. When you go into the linear productview, all products are added dynamically, so if you add a new product to the xml, it will automatically be added to the productspage. 

CSS: Used to style the HTML. We have used several css sheets to separate the files, to make it more orderly. We have used CSS in such a way that all pages have the same theme, and you get an impression of a simple, clean design. 

HTML: The skeleton of our webpage. We have used some of the new technology HTML5 has to offer; form validating, and canvas.

Validating forms: Used "required" on the "Contact us"-form, both Name and Email is required to press the submit-button. Also used the email-type, so the email-input from the user has to be on the form: "something@somthing" or "some@some.com".

Javascript: Javascript is being used to make the dropdown-menu from the navigationbar. It's also being used to make the canvas at the "About"-page. Lastly it's being used to read the XML-file, and view it in the correct containers. The script files has been separated some, to make it more readable, and to make it tidy when going through the files. We also used Javascript for sorting products after category.
