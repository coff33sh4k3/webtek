	<h4> About this website</h4>
	
	<p> Sad Penguin Fun Shop is one of the worlds biggest fraud companies. Being nominated for the 6th time this year as "one of the places NOT to buy stuff online". We are proud to announce that we are in the top ten most unreliable webshops, tied with arngren.net. All our products are manufactured by real chinese childrenhands, and are made with love and care. Our biggest achievement this year is to not have any palm oil in our products.</p>

	<p>Everything you read above is almost true, except for the part with palm oil. We have alot of it in our products. With that being said, this webpage is made as a group project and should not be taken serious. All rights reserved! Or something like that. Peace and love out. Party hard. All night.</p>

	<h4>This is us</h4>
